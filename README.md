# Cairo

Cairo is a C++ implementation of trading systems testing framework. It's mostly for educational purposes of learning C++ and algorithmic trading validation. A lot of "back-tested" strategies rely primarily on simple historical data backtesting or some variant of t-tests (or summary statistics such as Sharpe and mean), bootstraping, and OOS/Walk-forward.

I am interested in finding out how many of these strategies can survive this more rigorous statistical testing.

* ðŸ§ª Testing
  * [ ] see how things pan out
